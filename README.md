# Mapping_Earthquakes
In this analysis we used API call to retrieve the data of past 7 days of earthquakes, Tectonic plates and major earthquakes. The data was depicted on the the maps to show the earthquake occurances and intensity. Maps are created using Leaflet.js library, Javascript, and HTML to retrieve earthquake information from a GeoJSON file and plot the results in a visual format. Scripts are built using JavaScript and D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data.
